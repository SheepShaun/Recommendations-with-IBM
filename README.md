# Recommendations-with-IBM
In this project, I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like.

This project includes four sections:

(1) Exploratory data analysis

(2) Rank based recommendation

(3) User-User based collaborative filtering

(4) Content based recommendation

(5) Matrix factorization
